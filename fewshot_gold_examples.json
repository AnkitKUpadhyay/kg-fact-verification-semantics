Examining the evidence: we have birth date and birth year information, but critically, there are NO triples about education, almaMater, or university attendance. In knowledge graphs, if someone attended a notable educational institution, this would typically be documented alongside other biographical data. The complete absence of any education-related triples, while other biographical details are present, supports the claim that he did not attend college.",

[2] shows 90720.0 is the rotation period of '60 Echo' - but the claim says 190720.0 (double the actual value).
